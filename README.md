# India-Air-Quality-Data-Analysis
The main focus of this project is learning about modeling of data by supervised algorithms i.e
(Linear Regression (regression), Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifer, Decision
Tree Classifier (classification)). The main focus of this particular project is AQI(Air Quality
Index), and factors that affects AQI i.e (so2, no2, spm, rspm,). In this project a basic data
analysis is done on India Air Quality data and the value of Air Quality Index based on given
features of concentration of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, respirable suspended
particulate matter, suspended particulate matter were predicted and classification of the Air
Quality as good, satisfactory, moderately polluted, poor, very poor and severe was done.
